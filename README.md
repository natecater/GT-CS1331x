<h3><bold>Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java</bold></h3>

<p>This class was one of the three suggested courses that the Georgia Tech MS in CS program required for students conditionally admitted to the program. Although I was fully admitted to the program, I decided to take these prep courses anyways to better prepare for certain classes in the program. I'm taking this course in my first semester along with Human-Computer Interaction and Database Systems Concepts and Design in the MS program (and working in an internship). I intend to complete it soon, so that I can also take Data Structures & Algorithms hopefully by the end of the semester.</p>

While I have used Eclipse in a previous course as my IDE for Java, the instructor of this course advocated for using a plain text editor that's already available with your computer, so all of the code uploaded here for the homework was written in a plain text editor (TextEdit) and compiled and executed using bash/terminal.
